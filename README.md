# minesweeper

Unreviewed project for Codecademy build FE web applications class.  Minesweeper is a simple terminal-based app written in Javascript that allows you to play the minesweeper game. 

src/game.js and src/board.js are modules which can be run from node
minesweeper.js is the full program (since I couldn't get the transpiled version to work)

lib/* transpiled versions of the program (from npm run build) -- currently don't work
